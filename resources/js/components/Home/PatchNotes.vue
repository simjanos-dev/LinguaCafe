                        If DeepL is disabled for a language, the dictionaries will not show a DeepL error message anymore,

                        For better performance and to avoid accidentaly opening hover vocabulary on words, a slight delay was added before
                        the hover vocabulary box becomes visible. The dictionary and DeepL searches already had this delay, it just has
                        been applied to the visibility of the hover vocabulary box as well.

                        Added dynamic language model loading. Models are only going to be loaded at the first import for each language. This will significantly decrease memory use based on which and how many langauges are used on a server after its startup.

                        A list of words which were not counted in the statistics now will be automatically set to ignored when imported. Also added all numbers and more symbols to the list.

                        Increased maximum execution time for importing dictionaries. If your dictionary import did not end with a success message but still functional, I recommend importing it again, because it probably did not import all the records from the dictionary file.

                        "Hide all highlighting" and "Hide new word highlighting". This makes it possible to hide only the

                        on the text reader page, and it broke the software if the user clicked on them.
