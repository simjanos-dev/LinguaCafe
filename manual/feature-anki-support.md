# Anki

Currently Anki is supported if your server and Anki run on the same PC and have the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) plugin installed.

To set up an Anki's connection, head over to **Admin** > **API** >**Anki**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Future versions of LinguaCafe won't have this requirement.
