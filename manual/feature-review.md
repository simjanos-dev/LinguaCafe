# Review

After reading your texts and creating highlighted words and phrases, you can review them on the **Review page**. You can review words from a specific **book**, **chapter**, or you can review them all at once.

LinguaCafe uses a spaced repetition system (SRS) similar to the Leitner system, but you can export your highlighted cards to Anki or other SRS software if you want. To update LinguaCafe's SRS settings, head over to **Admin** > **Reviews**, and follow the instructions.
