# How can I tell a known word and an ignored word apart?

In the default themes, both known and ignored words aren't highlighted and they appear alike in the text. However if you click a word, the **Vocabulary sidebar** shows the word's level. A word whose level is a checkmark is a **known** word while a word with a cross is an **ignored** word. Ignored words do not count in learned word statistics.

# Do words that were imported with a specific source get deleted if I delete the source?

No, they don't. An imported vocabulary word doesn't ever get deleted.

# How much memory does LinguaCafe use?
