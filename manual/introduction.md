# Introduction

LinguaCafe is a free, web-based and self-hosted platform to help you read text in a foreign language. It provides you with a set of tools to read, look up, and review unknown words, and do so as effortlessly as possible.

LinguaCafe contains a few core features to facilitate learning a language through reading:
- Choosing languages and importing dictionaries.
- Creating, importing, and editing text from source such as ebooks, websites, Youtube subtitles, etc.
- Highlighting words, marking them as known, unknown, or completely ignoring them.
- Reviewing words you're learning using LinguaCafe's own SRS implementation, or exporting them to Anki.
