# Reading

Supplementing your language learning with LinguaCafe boils down to reading and reviewing the words you're learning in context. When you first start reading, all your words will be new, which means you haven't seen them before in LinguaCafe.  

Whenever you select a word you don't know, and you add a translation for it, be it from the built-in vocabulary search or manually, you will start to learn this word. As you review the words you're learning, you start getting closer to learning them. Once you learn a word, this word becomes known.

There are words you don't want to learn or simply want to ignore, for example proper nouns, foreign words, etc, which is why LinguaCafe also allows you to ignore words, in which case they won't count towards the learned word statistics.

We can summarize the words by level in LinguaCafe as follows:
- **New**, words that you haven't seen before, or haven't started to learn yet.
- **Learning**, words that you're currently learning. LinguaCafe uses integers in the range from 1 to 7 to determine how often these should appear in reviews. The closer a word is to 0, the closer you're to learning it and the less it appears in reviews.
- **Known**, words that have reached the level 0 via reviews or that you checked in the **Vocabulary sidebar** by clicking the checkmark.
- **Ignored**, words that you've explicitly ignored by clicking the cross in the **Vocabulary sidebar**. 

New words and words you're currently learning are highlighted, however the colors used depend on the theme you're using. Here's a summary for the default themes:

| Theme | New | Learning | Known | Ignored |
| :--- | :--- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Light | Yellow | Green | No highlighting | No highlighting |
| Dark | Yellow | Green | No highlighting | No highlighting |
| Eink | Underlined | Black | No highlighting | No highlighting |

In addition to saving words, LinguaCafe also allows you to save multiple words as a **phrase**. With your mouse, left-click on a word and drag it onto the next one until you've selected all the adjacent words you want. When you're done selecting words, the **New phrase** pop-up will come up where you can add a translation for the phrase, set its level, and save it.

When you reach the end of a chapter, you can click the **Finished reading** button to set all words in the chapter to known. 

>[!CAUTION]
>The effect of clicking the **Finished reading** button cannot be undone, thus exercise some caution when clicking it. If you don't know all the words in the chapter and/or you don't want to set them all to known, then don't click it. Words that have been set to anything, such as known, cannot be reverted back to new.
